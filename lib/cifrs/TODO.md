- Can we move configuration to YAML files similar to how linguist works?
- Can we support overriding cifrs detection via git attributes similar to linguist?
  - Outside of that if its doable, this might not be necessary as we'll provide a way to override options within doctavious but it wouldn't be helpful to those who are running it outside of Doctavious
- Should CLI be specifically baked into Doctavious CLI or should it also be a separate CLI? Would need to determine how to make that work but I think we need to anyway if we want to incorporate Snippext into Doctavous CLI. Some work to review
