# Team Topologies

A template for defining a Team API. A Team API is a description and specification that a team can define that tells others how to interact with that team.

Based on some of the ideas in the book Team Topologies by Matthew Skelton @matthewskelton and Manuel Pais @manupaisable. See pages 47-49 of the book Team Topologies.
